## 💼 About Me

I began my career as a full stack developer, honing my skills in creating dynamic applications that brought ideas to life. Over time, my curiosity drew me toward the transformative potential of AI/ML, igniting a deep interest in using data to solve complex problems. This growing fascination pushed me to explore new ways of thinking, where every dataset became an opportunity to uncover hidden patterns and innovative possibilities.

This shift has reshaped my journey, and I now see myself as an AI/ML engineer, passionate about turning data into meaningful insights that can shape the future. My mission is to harness this evolving expertise to craft innovative solutions that drive progress and address real-world challenges, blending my technical foundation with a forward-thinking approach. I am committed to continuous learning and collaboration, aiming to contribute to projects that make a lasting impact while adapting to the ever-changing landscape of technology.
